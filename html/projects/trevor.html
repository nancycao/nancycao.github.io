<h2> Facebook Messenger Bot for Legal Advice </h2>
<h3> Top Hack @ CodeDay NY 2017 </h3>
    <h2>Created with <a href="https://github.com/cyan478" target="_blank"> Celine Yan </a> and <a href="https://github.com/FDWraith" target="_blank"> Kevin Zhang </a> </h2>

<br>

<h5>Purpose</h5>
<p>
The inspiration for this project stemmed from the controversial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13769">immigration ban</a> implemented by executive order of President Trump on January 27, 2017. With so many lawyers and legal advisors who converged to numerous protests around the globe and provided legal advice to those who needed it, we wanted to develop a tool to facilitate these private exchanges of personal information.
</p>
    
<h5>Outcome</h5>
<p>
We created a prototype Messenger Bot who lives on Facebook, a popular social media platform worldwide, to facilitate confidential legal advising virtually.
</p>
    
<h5>Challenges</h5>
    <h6>How could we make these exchanges confidential?</h6>
    <p>
    Since we were dealing with sensitive legal information being passed back and forth, we had to design a system that preserved confidentiality.
        
    <img src="../../img/trevor/message.PNG">
    In order to preserve anonimity, all the messages passed from the legal advice receiver and legal advisor are transmitted through the Messenger Bot as shown above. Trevor acts as a pipe to pass messages from one party to the other without revealing the identity of the asker.
    </p>
    <h6>How do we code a Messenger Bot?</h6>
    <p>
    None of us had experience in working with a Messenger Bot before but we had to complete our prototype within 24 hours for CodeDay NY. 
    We leveraged an open-source repository for a starter<a href="https://github.com/hartleybrody/fb-messenger-bot" target="_blank"> Python Facebook Messenger Bot</a>.
    </p>
    
<h5>Messenger Bot Demo</h5>
The following images contain actual messenges that were sent to and from our deployed chatbot. We will first walkthrough the asker's user process.

<h5>Technical Information</h5> 
<p>We utilized the Facebook Messenger Bot API and programmed using Python in a Python Wrapper provided by Hartly Brody. We retained Client and Volunteer input information in a SQLite database. According to the Messenger Bot instructions, we deployed using Heroku for our Messenger Bot to be live.</p>

<h5>Reflections</h5> 
<p> This hackathon was a great way to learn how to quickly complete a prototype in a limited amount of time using open-source tools available to us. In the future, we would like to make sure that the system we pass messages through cannot be intercepted since secruity is the upmost concern for this project. We would also like to research more about features that both legal adivors and advisees need such as: expanding the topics of legal inquiries and the types of preliminary questions would be helpful for a legal advisor to have beforehand from the advisee.
